# Paperspace Take Home

## Summary
My application is built with MaterialUI components, while using `react-markdown` to render the markdown directly. I built a minimal Express server with a single piece of middleware to handle fetching from the API.

**NOTE: If you'd like to switch the markdown file, just change the source URL located in the `APIController` assigned to `UPDATE_GIST`.**

## Installation
`npm i` to start installing required packagesâ€”note that I have `eslint` and `prettier` installed for linting/formatting. The `dev` script to run the app in development mode.

## To-do's
- Add more styling to update drawer
- Add .env folder and assign environmental variables
- Use JWT for notification updates
